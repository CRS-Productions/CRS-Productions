- 👋 Hi, I’m @CRS-Productions
- 👀 I’m interested in Access databasses
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Database distrubution
- 📫 How to reach me KTOS.Databases@Gmail.com
First of all I am here to learn how Github might help me distribute these database packages to users that might want to uses them.

I am developing the KTOS Databases using MS Access 2019 and MS Excel.

The KTOS Buildings database is one that I have worked on for 21 years.
First 10 years as I worked for the city I developed an app for “The City of Daytona Beach” for their “Statement of Values” insurance program
and later added the maintenance work order section to it. 
They used it from 2000 to 2010 after that they went to a vendor that added Police, Fire and Water Billing and put it on the Web for user access
at this time they stopped using my app. 
Now That I have retired in 2010 I work on it to keep my mind in shape I guess it is a hobby for me. 
Now I am thinking about trying to wrap it up for giving it out to users in the public works area for asset maintenance and work order request 
and following up with expenditures and tracking for assets work order numbers, charge codes and other information.
This app can be also be used in the factory/manufacturing area for maintenance.

One other is an Excel workbook that is for a family home banking system that keeps track of bank statements, check book, credit card purchases, 
BOGOs has a way to keep track of money for home petty cash, home bank and has a yearly page for totals.
